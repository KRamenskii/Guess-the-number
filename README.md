The project used the MVP architecture, since when using this architecture, responsibilities are clearly divided between entities. The processing of user actions was carried out using the presenter, which made it possible to separate the logic and display in different angles. And also I am more familiar with this architecture than with the others, which is one of the main factors in choosing the project architecture.
